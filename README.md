# Udacity-Portfolio-Project-Site
This is a repository for my Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Program's Portfolio Project
The goal of this project was to create a sample portfolio of my work thus far in the course
The Bootstrap 3 framework was used for this build and will be a first iteration of a more updated future work featuring interactivity
The buttons below the images were used for giving credit to the photographer and as a challenge in making things functional
All buttons and links are functional, also featuring a LinkedIn Avatar image and link to my LinkedIn profile
Positioned left is a color palette detailing the colors used
